# Leviathan: Linear Algebra and Game Math with Type Safety

A standalone module for doing type-safe linear algebra with small statically sized matrices mixed with matrices with dynamic dimensions. Leviathan is capable of *safely mixing* multiplication of matrices with one, two, or no dynamically determined dimensions against other matrices. For example, Leviathan deems multiplication of a `3 x Dyn` matrix times a `Dyn x 4` matrix to be valid, and resulting in a `3 x 4` matrix (any time `Dyn` dimensions appear in a matrix multiplication/matrix operation, the value of `Dyn` is checked at runtime.) Similarly, multiplying a `Dyn x 3` matrix times a `3 x 2` matrix is valid, and results in a `Dyn x 2` size matrix. Because `Dyn` can only be known at runtime, Leviathan also allows `N x Dyn` times `M x P`, but checks at runtime to be sure that `Dyn == M`. Leviathan's matrix multiplication is currently implemented naively, but in the future may leverage BLAS for matrices larger than a suitable cutoff. (The only planned possible dependency for Leviathan may be BLAS. Otherwise, Leviathan is intended to be entirely dependency-free.) Building currently requires the nightly Rust build because of `#![feature(specialization)]`, but the use of other feature gates will not occur, so once specialization becomes stable, Leviathan should also become stable. Internally, Leviathan uses Peano-encoded type level integers for managing dimensions of N-dimensional arrays, matrices, and vectors; moving to a binary encoding is on the agenda, for more efficient addition, subtraction, and less compile-time memory usage.
